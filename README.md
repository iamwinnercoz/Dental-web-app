# Dental Web App

This project is a Django-based web application developed to streamline the management of dental clinics. The platform offers a range of features for both dental practitioners and patients, enabling them to efficiently handle appointments, patient records, billing, and more. It ensures that dental clinics can maintain a smooth workflow while delivering high-quality services to their patients.

## Project Description

The **Dental Web App** is designed to assist dental clinics in managing various aspects of their operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for patients to book appointments and view their treatment history, while offering dentists and administrative staff tools to efficiently manage patient data, schedules, and billing. The app also includes features to automate reminders and notifications, reducing manual effort and improving patient engagement.

### Key Objectives

- **Streamlined Appointment Booking**: Allows patients to book appointments online and receive confirmations, while helping dentists maintain an organized schedule.
- **Patient Records Management**: Stores and manages patient data, including dental history, treatments, prescriptions, and future care plans.
- **Billing and Invoicing**: Automates the creation of invoices for services rendered, simplifying the billing process for the clinic.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Supports different user roles (Admin, Dentist, Patient), ensuring that users only have access to features relevant to their role.
- **Reporting**: Admins and dentists can generate reports on patient visits, treatments, clinic performance, and other key metrics.
- **Notification System**: Automated email or SMS reminders for upcoming appointments, ensuring patients are always informed.
